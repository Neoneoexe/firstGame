Space Shooter
Welcome to Space Shooter! This is a retro-style game where you get to pilot a spaceship and shoot down aliens. The goal of the game is to get as many points as possible by shooting down as many aliens as you can.

Gameplay
You control your spaceship using the arrow keys on your keyboard. Use the up arrow key to move your spaceship upwards, the down arrow key to move your spaceship downwards, and the space bar to shoot at aliens. The aliens will move back and forth across the screen, so you'll have to be quick to shoot them down.

If you hit an alien, you'll earn 10 points. If an alien hits your spaceship, you'll lose a life. You start with 3 lives, so be careful!
